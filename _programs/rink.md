# Skating & Hockey Rink
During the winter months Empire Park hosts an outdoor skating which typically opens mid to late December
through February, weather permitting. The rink is open to free skating and hockey throughout the season.

## Equipment Rentals
For our members & day users Empire Park keeps a small stock of skates, hockey sticks and helmets. Equipment
loans for the skating season are available to members in good standing. If you wish to rent skates for season
please contact our rink coordinator at [rink@empirepark.ca](mailto:rink@empirepark.ca) or in person during operating hours.

## Learn To Skate
In partnership with the City of Edmonton, Empire Park Community League hosts a drop in learn to skate program where
participants of all ages can learn basic skating skills through fun and games.

Instructors are City of Edmonton program staff. Classes will be cancelled in the cases where the weather dips below 
-25Â°C with wind chill. Live updates will be posted to our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/empireparksw/) page

<!-- ## Medicine Cup Charity Tournament (MCCT)
It's that time of year again where Empire Park welcomes the MCC Tournament which will be held at our rink, along with
other nearby rinks on February 3rd-5th to raise funds in support of [Little Warriors](http://littlewarriors.ca/).

For those interested in helping the Medicine Cup Charity Tournament in raising money for Little Warriors, email
